                    Li’s reading, Overview of Data Visualization (2020), 
                    coherently defines what data visualization is and considers the connection between it and aesthetics.  
                    To understand traditional data visualization, it explains the definitions of two terms: information and data;
                    and discusses their characteristics and forms. The chapter then summarizes the cues of data visualization, these are: 
                    Waveform, Charts, Tables, Graphics, Volumes, Trees, Diagrams, Simulations, and Scatter plots. Then it briefly discusses the 
                    importance of data visualization on perception.

                <p>
                    <h1 class="subject"> 2.1. Data Visualization as a theory</h1>
                    <p>
                        Data visualization is used in many investigations and studies to collect facts to prove certain phenomena. Erin McCoy in their 
                        research stated that “visuals communicate information sixty thousand times faster than text.” (2019), this proves that humans understand
                        information that is visually represented better and faster, and visuals have an impact on shaping human insight, this is because the illustrations 
                        are eye-catching which draw the reader to focus more on them than on the text (McCoy, 2019). Back then, humans always had ways of communicating using 
                        illustrations to tell stories and spread information, an example is the hieroglyphic symbols that were used for communication and to record history and stories
                        by the ancient Egyptians (Anas, 2021).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        All those drawings which were used to tell stories in the late centuries existed in a period that we know as the pre-digital age, 
                        and the exciting part is that they never faded. What I mean by ‘they never faded’ is that there has never been a day whereby we interacted with information that had no illustrations till this day,
                        from the cover of a book to the news we read on the internet. To think about it, information technology and the term ‘data’ came about and were innovated in this digital age through the assistance of drawings, 
                        I emphasize this point because visuals can convey meaning in a short space and time. These developments in information technology have brought a lot of change in how visuals have been represented, they moved from traditional 
                        (hand drawn) to digital (computer-generated graphics). The theory is conceptualized in different ways such as statistical graphics, information visualization, and information graphics (Brush & Burns, 2020).
                    </p>
    
                    <p>
                        The importance of data visualization is to ensure that people fully understand the information that they interact with, with clear perception, and have a long-lasting memory of the knowledge they gain from the information. 
                        The theory has a couple of advantages this includes, representing a huge amount of data all at once; enabling the spectators to pick up developing effects in the data to notice and prepare for a new view; it makes it easier for 
                        a data analyst to instantly identify problems for product quality control; and it deepens the understanding of small-scale and large-scale data (Li, 2020: 18).
                    </p>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <h2 class="subtitle"> 2.1.1. What is Data Visualization?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The concept is an integration of two terms, these are data which from my understanding is collected information that is represented digitally, and visualization which is a process of creating graphics to convey meaning.
                        From these definitions, I define data visualization as a technique used to collect information and represent it using computer-generated graphics to convey meaning.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Brush and Burns define data visualization as and I quote, “…the practice of translating information into a visual context, such as a map or graph, to make data easier for the human brain to understand and pull insights from.” (2020). 
                        What I understood from this definition is that data visualization is responsible for the examination of human perception (Li, 2020: 17), it is a simple signifier to convey meaning and make the reader digest what is being communicated faster,
                        it re-enforces the holding of information through graphics. The concept can be defined from different perspectives, focusing on the relationship between computer technology and data (Li, 2020: 17-18) because these two terms help us understand data 
                        visualization better. Another definition of data visualization is “the representation and presentation of data that exploits our visual perception abilities to amplify cognition” (Kirk in Li, 2020: 18), this definition simply means that data visualization
                        is data that is represented to trigger our brains to process information faster and reinforce knowledge. I guess all definitions focus on one thing, i.e., our understanding of what the visuals we see are delivering, the message behind the visualized data.
                        Could data and information mean the same thing? I will briefly explain these two terms below.
                    </p>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h2 class="subtitle"> 2.1.2. The Meaning of Information and Data</h2>
                    <p>
                        I have already explained above what I think data means. Data has two forms, primary data (untested data) and secondary data (given information), I believe in the case of data visualization theory we are referring to secondary data because what is presented to the reader 
                        is prepared data. On the other hand, information is defined as data that is progressed (Li, 2020: 22), meaning that it is presented to humans as facts that then shapes the world. Traditional data visualization has two types, these are, scientific visualization and information 
                        visualization (Li, 2020: 22), which I will briefly explain. 
                    </p>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h2 class="subtitle"> 2.1.3. Types of Traditional Data Visualization</h2>
                    <p>
                        These types of data visualization also have ordinary forms which could also classify as their examples. <span>Scientific visualization</span> is the type of visualization that focuses on the visual data examination, it represents data pictorially with its focus being on understanding and
                        accessing the perception of technological data. Its forms are waveforms, simulations, and volume (Li, 2020: 22).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <span>Information visualization</span> is the activity of visually representing academic facts that can be easily understood by humans, its forms include maps, trees, graphs, tables, diagrams, scatterplots, and charts. This visualization is observed as information design, which as its major duty seeks
                        to outline the coherent conveying of information, to give out unbiased and precise content through the visual representations (Li, 2020: 23).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The form of data that is selected for data visualization depends on the type of data that we are dealing with (Li, 2020: 22). Looking briefly at the data visualization common forms:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        •	<span>Maps</span>: A map is a 2D representation of a space, e.g., the world. It focuses on pointing out the connection between the aspects of space e.g., 2D space, 3D spaces, or 4D space.
                        Maps are static and they help people navigate through the world easily using different types of maps, for instance, the physical map, which shows geographic features such as rivers or mountains, 
                        as well as infrastructures such as buildings or roads (Li, 2020: 26).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        •	<span>Trees</span>: Trees record species' revolution, lineage, and social forms. Their stratified structure also known as the Tree-Map is used to identify data from the origin to its uprooting, 
                        its advantage is to demonstrate, justify, and arrange facts (Li, 2020: 24).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        •	<span>Scatterplots</span>: These are mostly used in technological research to represent data in variables or 2D (Li, 2020: 28) using dots to present the results of the investigation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        •	<span>Tables</span>: They are used to compare or differentiate data using columns and rows. These columns and rows can use symbols or words and the data becomes more coherent and
                        easier to read as well as understand (Li, 2020: 30). Li uses a timetable as an example, as it shows scheduled events, mostly used in schools (2020: 31).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        •	<span>Graphs</span>: They show the relationship between variable numbers, using lines and bars. It provides the perception of data (Li, 2020: 35).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        •	<span>Charts</span>: They are like graphs and tables, data is represented in a structure of bars, and lines, whereas traditionally we use graphs or tables (Li, 2020:29), 
                        for instance, in schools whereby learners must draw charts to differentiate the results of a certain experiment visually.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        •	<span>Diagrams</span>: Similar to graphs, they show the flow of information through lines and rectangles, mostly used in business industries for system analysis. 
                        When the data is presented in a form of a graph, it can cause problems when there is a huge quantity of data (Li, 2020: 32).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        •	<span>Waveform</span>: It is used for illustrating the appearance of time connected to several groups of information. It gives us the visual representation of information 
                        with wavelengths and frequencies, e.g., can be used in medicine (Li, 2020: 35). 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        •	<span>Simulation</span>: Used to examine global climate and weather changes so that people can be warned about upcoming climate changes, it uses 3D to represent its information (Li, 2020: 37-38). 
                        Keeping track of the period the changes occurred and presenting the nature phenomenon accurately. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        •	<span>Volume</span>: It creates a visual representation of information using 3D grids. It consists of two types of data; these are vector data and scalar data.
                        Scalar data carries unique values at a certain point while on the other hand vector data carries multiple values at a certain point (Li, 2020: 39). It can be split into five types: 
                        emulation, slice-based approach, volume rendering, direct and indirect volume rendering (Tukalo in Li, 2020: 39-40).
                    </p>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h2 class="subtitle"> 2.1.4. Aspects of Traditional Data Visualization</h2>
                    <p>
                        To design a good data visualization that considers human perception, we must consider the aspects of data visualization, these are readability which focuses on giving out content that has 
                        quality and is clearly illustrated; recognizability enabling the reader to be aware of the content; and lastly meaning which reinforce the message the image is conveying (Li, 2020: 41-42).  
                        All these aspects are important when creating data visualization so that readers can understand every bit of information that the visual representations are conveying.
                    </p>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h1 class="subject"> 2.2. Data Visualization and Human Insight</h1>
                    <p>
                        I could say data visualization is all about making humans understand information better using visual representations. Li explains the term perception as “the way sensory data is organized, 
                        interpreted, and consciously experienced” (2020: 42), from my understanding it is about using your senses and being aware and interpreting information to understand it fully. 
                        Human insight is a mental activity (Li, 2020: 42), which helps with understanding data that is graphically presented, as I had already mentioned above that the human brain processes 
                        data and acknowledges it faster than text (McCoy, 2019).
                    </p>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h2 class="subtitle"> 2.2.1. The Mental Process</h2> 
                    <p>
                        This process focuses on how humans give attention to the visualized information, there is a process known as preattentive processing, it has four approaches, these are: texton theory 
                        (study of texture patterns), feature integration theory (theory of attention), guided search theory (visual search approach), and similarity theory (focuses on the time of perception) (Healey in Li, 2020: 43).  
                        Data visualization focuses on the human senses specifically vision, to examine how we acquire knowledge using graphics.
                    </p>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h1 class="subject"> 2.3. Conclusion</h1>
                    <p>
                        Visual representations play an important role in the way we gain knowledge. We use one of our senses i.e., vision, to understand data and interpret it faster than text. 
                        The theory of data visualization is used to examine human perception and learn how the brain digests data that is graphically presented faster. The theory has visual forms which are used to represent data,
                        these common forms are: scatterplots, tables, trees, graphs, charts, diagrams, maps, simulation, volume, and waveforms; a lot of these forms are similar such as the graphs being similar to the diagrams. 
                        I believe this was a good reading and something to emphasize why and how humans interpret graphics faster.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The chapter gives us an insight into the aspects we must focus on when creating data visualization, which are readability, recognizability, and meaning. 
                        I found this very important because some creators may forget aspects like the very important readability one. After all, the reader must easily read the data.  
                        Then lastly, the author goes on to explain what the purpose of data visualization is in terms of understanding human perception while looking at some approaches that help explain the process, 
                        these approaches include texton theory, feature integration theory, guided search theory, and similarity theory. The common forms of data visualization do not focus on how the design is, 
                        but the focal point is on making sure that the visualized data is coherently, visibly, and meaningfully represented to make the reader easily digest the information.
