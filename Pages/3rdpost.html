                <p>
                    <h2 class="subject">1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        “Interactive design is the practice of designing interactive digital products and services” (Babich, 2019). 
                        From my understanding of Babich’s definition, interaction design is the communication between the interface and a user, 
                        connecting the person to the product psychologically and physically through usability, flexibility, and accessibility of the interface.
                        Dimara and Perin’s article titled What is the Interaction for Data Visualization? (2020), analyzes which fundamentals can be integrated to 
                        define interaction briefly and coherently with remarkable insight. They started by examining other researchers’ work positioned on how they define
                        interaction in the visualization perspective and explored how the human-computer interaction (HCI) discipline defines interaction; after these analyses 
                        and quantitative research, they compared and differentiated the two insights. To reach their concluded definition of interaction for visualization, 
                        they integrate the different perspectives by considering observable logic, technical visualization, and data visualization. To further elucidate their definition, 
                        they explained where interaction appears linguistically in the visualization system (Dimara and Perin, 2020).
                    </p>

                <p>
                    <h3 class="subject">2. Analysis of interaction behind visualization</h3>
                    <p>
                        The authors gathered research papers that had an insight into what interaction is from other perspectives, this was to avoid being biased, 
                        be open-minded, and understand what interaction is while considering other views. They did a critical analysis of the information they collected, 
                        to point out the most important components. For them to carry out the investigation they stated three obligations, which explained their methodological analysis (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 120).
                    </p>
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    <h4 class="subtitle">2.1. Methodological Analysis</h4>
                    <p>
                        <span>1st obligation</span>: The outlook of interaction must have a professional input and not be recorded by citation only, 
                        meaning the paper must be legit and there must be reviews from other scholars.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>2nd obligation</span>: Capturing papers starting with papers that were noted down as highly important and broadening with other 
                        back and forward references is not acceptable as it appears as being biased.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>3rd obligation</span>: The examination must not involve HCI papers that do not focus on visualization. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I believe the authors used what we refer to in the FVPAIIIA course as the CRAAP Test, which is a test that gives five criteria to consider when relying on a source (Duncan, 2022). 
                        From the CRAAP Test, the authors focused more on R-Relevance, which sees the importance of the information and if it relates to the topic; and C-Currency, which focuses on the timeline 
                        of the information and how many times the information has been published (Dimara and Perin, 2020; Duncan, 2022). They did well by considering using relevant sources so that the information 
                        they give out is also relevant and thoughtful. Continuing their research, they then conducted quantitative research i.e., a questionnaire.
                    </p>
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    <h5 class="subtitle">2.2. Examination Questionnaire</h5>
                    <p>
                        The questionnaire was in a form of sending online forms to researchers expecting the following from them: papers that define interaction within visualization; applicable papers to the main topic 
                        (relevance); their years of visualization experience more like authority from the CRAAP Test; and points that describe how familiar they are with interaction (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 121). 
                        During the collection of the important papers, the authors followed four steps briefly explained below.
                    </p>
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    <h6 class="subtitle">2.3. Process of gathering papers</h6>
                    <p>
                        <span>Step 1</span>: They made a list of 5 interpretation papers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>Step 2</span>: Received suggested papers from other authors through the questionnaire.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>Step 3</span>: They checked the papers’ reliability following the CRAAP Test I mentioned above, 
                        to know the currency, relevance, authority, accuracy, and purpose of the sources before they could rely on them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>Step 4</span>: They sent the questionnaire again to different authors.  Then repeated step 3 and stopped the process 
                        when no new references where found (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 121).
                    </p> 
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    <h2 class="subtitle">2.4. Labelling papers with interaction topics</h2>
                    <p>
                        The authors made tags that will help classify which seed papers had interaction ideas and definitions. They used 6 tags:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        • 	<span>Description</span>: The paper coherently elucidates the term ‘interaction’.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	<span>Evaluative</span>: There is resentment and criticism about what interaction is, to enhance thoughts and objections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	<span>Advantages</span>: The paper gives positive elements and benefits of interaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	<span>Interaction idea</span>: There is definition and ideas of interaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	<span>Directory</span>: classification of interaction intents (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 121).
                    </p>
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    <h3 class="subject">3. Components that interaction behind visualization must include</h3>
                    <p>
                        Internal and external systems as well as internal and external actions, which I will briefly discuss below, are the compulsory components that the description papers include.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>Internal and external systems</span>: The external system allows the user to interact with the data, this can be through a mouse or a touch on the screen. 
                        The user is the person who commences the interaction and showcases their abilities, then the data is the information that the user focuses on and manipulates through their skills. 
                        Inversely, the internal system focuses on the goals the user must accomplish when they interact with the system. This involves data-oriented intent (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 122), 
                        whereby intent is considered the goal of the user.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>Internal and external actions</span>: Internal actions occur psychologically; it is what the user thinks and how they feel about the visualization system. 
                        While external actions are the actions a user takes to change and manipulate the presentation of information visualization. There can also be an external action of 
                        communication between a user and another user about the product which can also bring new knowledge and data (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 122).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are some terms we can confuse the term ‘interaction’ with such as interactivity or interaction technique. Interactivity can be used interchangeably with interaction, 
                        but they are not the same, interactivity is defined as the process of how the user feels when they interact with a product and how they influence it or vice versa. 
                        The interaction technique unlike interaction does not focus on the intent but it provides a way for the users to achieve a specific task (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 123). 
                        Through interaction, knowledge is gained and shared, the more interaction there is with different products the more information will be shared and fixed.
                        Some of the benefits of interaction are the development and enhancement of communication and problem-solving skills, Dimara and Perin also state that 
                        “interaction leverages humans’ natural abilities through new visualization shapes, modalities, and input technologies” (2020: 123). This means that the development of information 
                        technology and visualization pipelines strengthens human capacities and helps them learn new things through interacting with new data visualizations.
                        The authors identified three ideas from their analyses that form the concept of interaction behind visualization namely: task-center, human-center, 
                        and system-center (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 123). Task-center draws the roles the user must play and the tasks they must complete for them to accomplish the goal. 
                        Human-center expresses interaction as user intent, which focuses on the user’s intentions towards pursuing the goal, there are activities the user must interact with 
                        such as giving insights on how they find the product to be effective. System-center expresses interaction in terms of the mechanics, these mechanics neither define the role of the user 
                        nor focus on the user intent or how the user interacts with the product (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 123).
                        In the field of visualization, interaction is described as the communication between the user and the visualization system which displays the data. 
                        This communication has low external and internal flexibilities and there can be limitations of the user intentionality depending on what the goal is (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 123). 
                        To look further into these limitations the authors analyze human-computer interaction based on interaction.

                <p>
                    <h4 class="subject">4. HCI perspective considering interaction</h4>
                    <p>
                        The authors analyze the definition of interaction in terms of HCI, they look at how the definition can apply to the one of visualization then compare the two perspectives. 
                        They analyzed seven ideas that describe interaction in HCI and how each can bring good interaction (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 124).
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="subtitle">4.1. Seven ideas that describe interaction in HCI</h5>
                    <p>
                        •	<span>Dialogue</span>: The computer works based on input and output through the user’s insights and actions on the system, this results in what we see as communication between the user and the computer, 
                        and all this leads to the approach of interaction. A good interaction then is enhanced when the user understands the system, the navigation is smooth, and the communication is simple as well as direct. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	<span>Optimal behaviour</span>: The idea sees interaction as the ability for the user to be able to adapt to the changes in the interfaces, be able to express their capabilities through their completion of the tasks, 
                        and being able to perceive, navigate, and reason with the product. A good interaction is enhanced when the user can benefit from their interaction within the given limitations as they use their skills. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	<span>Transmission</span>: The idea sees interaction as the way information is transferred from the computer to the user. A good interaction is enhanced from the rate of the transmission, for instance, 
                        how fast the information is transmitted. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	<span>Tool use</span>: The idea sees interaction as the set of tools the user uses to interact with the computer, for example, a mouse. A good interaction is enhanced when the user can access any tool 
                        they want to use and the functionality of the tool. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	<span>Control</span>: The idea sees interaction as the usability and functionality of the system and the ability for the user to perform actions that will lead them to achieve the goal(s) while getting feedback from the system. 
                        Babich (2020) refers to this as “Ergonomics”, which aims to increase efficiency and reduce system and human errors. A good interaction is seen when there are little to no errors in the system which constrain or stop the user 
                        from reaching their goal and there is enough feedback for the user to see progress. 
                    </p>
                   <p>
                    •	<span>Experience</span>: The idea sees interaction as a theory that leads to user expectations, this focuses on how the user feels when they interact with the system. It focuses on the key factors of a good user experience 
                    e.g., aesthetical appeal, achievement, or sensation. A good interaction enhances the user’s satisfactions, the interface psychologically and spiritually connects the user with the system as well as meet the users’ expectations. 
                   </p>
                    <p>
                        •	<span>Embodiment</span>: The idea sees interaction as the way to making the user feel as part of the visualized world, it makes the user feel as a participant and character of the world. A good interaction drops all the monuments which 
                        do not make the user feel as if they are in the real world (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 124).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HCI does not require user intent as much as visualization does, interaction with visualization focuses on data-oriented intent whereby the user can complete more than one goal and intention is their main focal point 
                        (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 124-125). HCI focuses more on letting the user interact with the system without them having to focus on intent as their goal, it makes the user experience the product freely and flexibly while reaching the goal. 
                        According to Babich (2019), one of the principles of an interaction design is a goal-directed design that focuses on user satisfaction with the product, it enhances the user’s skill of problem-solving. The user must feel that they are moving 
                        towards achieving a goal when they interact with a product, this is important because it results in a good interaction design.
                        The user is an important entity for both HCI and visualization because it is the individual who must interact with the system for it to function. Users contribute to making information have the meaning the designer was 
                        trying to convey as they are the ones who determine whether the data is efficient or not. The computer then allows the user to have access to the data and give a response to the user's actions which explains how interaction in visualization functions.
                    </p>

                    <h6 class="subject">5. Differences between HCI interaction and VIS interaction</h6>
                    <h2 class="subtitle">5.1. Fundamental differences: Focus, Flexibility, Entities, and Intent</h2>
                    <p>
                        •	Focus: HCI aims to make the tools for interaction be usable and easy to access, to increase fulfillment and decrease effort. While visualization aims to enhance the user’s cognitive skills by making them think and reflect on the data they are engaging with.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Flexibility: Visualization requires flexibility in the tools, this means that interacting with the tool changes the engagement. On the contrary, the user sees flexibility through interaction with not just the tools but the whole system in HCI. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Entities: HCI tends to have two main entities which are the human and computer while visualization also includes a data entity, the data is the information the human interacts with through the computer, which then results in it having three entities these are computer, human, and data. 
                        Without these entities there will be no means of interaction.
                    </p>

                        •	Intent: Intent in HCI is not a necessity, as users produce their own intentions and aims outside the interaction. Visualization focuses on data-related intent and as it can also be referred to as data interface it differs from the HCI system because its system may not contain data (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 125-126).

                    <h3 class="subtitle">5.2. Definition of Interaction for visualization</h3>
                    <p>
                        The authors reached a definition of what interaction is through comparison of the two perspectives. Their definition was built on key components these are interplay, a person, data interface, action, action-reaction, reaction perceived as such, and data-related intent.
                        They defined interaction as “...the interplay between a person and a data interface involving a data-related intent, at least one action from the person, and an interface reaction that is perceived as such.” (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 126). Interaction for visualization was 
                        defined according to the visualization view because it requires user intent, and communication between the user and data is through the computer since it is the moderator. They used interaction elements which I mentioned above as catalysts to produce the definition.
                        To briefly explain the elements, firstly, interplay refers to the communication between the user and the system which applies to both the HCI and the visualization perspectives which can also include communication between users. A user is a person who interacts with the interfaces. 
                        Whereby, the data interface is a responsive system that contains data and has different controls allowing the user to manipulate the data through effective engagement and actions. The action then is the performance the user does to the interface so that it can respond (physical action), 
                        then there is a mental action whereby the user thinks of actions without performing them. Action-reaction is when the user acts then the data interface responds. Reaction perceived as such is when the user perceives the reaction that was given by the interface and understands the information the interfaces convey. 
                        Data-related intent then refers to the intention of achieving the goal, this does not only focus on user intent as the designer can also have intent when they design the data interface (Dimara and Perin, 2020: 126).
                        For a data interface to be interactive the system must be flexible to allow the user to perform actions and understand the information conveyed better. Dimara and Perin define flexibility as “…the number of distinct, allowable actions of a person on the interface, as well as the number of interaction means with 
                        which the person can perform each action.” (2020: 127). This means that flexibility allows the user to accomplish their goals without any constraints or errors limiting them to do so, the flexibility can be seen for instance, in the smooth usability of control tools such as the keyboard, the touch on the screen, 
                        mouse, joystick or accessibility of different nav bars.

                    <p>
                        The authors conducted both quantitative and qualitative research to help them build their definition, to prevent them from being biased, and let them have more insights about interaction from different perspectives, For the quantitative part of the research they did a questionnaire and sent it to different
                        visualization experts to assist them with finding more reliable sources on the main topic. They focused on two perspectives these were interaction in the HCI perspective and interaction in the visualization perspective. HCI perspective defines interaction as the communication between the user and the computer, 
                        the connection does not necessarily require intent and there might be an absence of data. Then the visualization perspective defines interaction as the communication between the user and the data through the computer and the interaction requires intent. Both perspectives consist of the user and the computer and 
                        the dialogue between these entities, but HCI does not depend on data for the interaction unlike visualization, this is because the interaction for visualization is data-oriented.
                        By examining the differences and similarities between the two perspectives, the authors managed to reach the definition of interaction for visualization. We can see from the question, they were working on answering: “What is interaction for visualization?”, the main terms are interaction and visualization, 
                        so their definition leaned more towards the visualization perspective because the focus was to define interaction behind data interfaces. Their definition was easy to understand, and the components used to build it were very thoughtful, I always thought of interaction as an easy term that was used to define 
                        the connection between two or a group of things and how they influence one another. Little did I know that there are different ideas to the concept, so the article was very eye-opening in terms of how a person can interact with a computer versus how they can interact with data visualization through a computer.
