                <h1 class="week"> What is User Interface and User Experience?</h1>
                <p>
                    The UI's purpose is to make the design appear user-friendly, meaningful, and attractive; 
                    it shows the visual design of a product. By interacting with the interfaces users can experience a psychological and spiritual connection with the design (Goldberg, 2022), 
                    this can be caused by its aesthetic appeal. For instance, a user can have a nostalgic feeling when they see the beauty of the design. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are three elements to creating a good UI, the first one is a visual representation which focuses on giving the design an artistic look including aspects such as color,
                    typography, and so on. The second one is an interactive representation that focuses on user input and allows the user to navigate the interface easily, an example is buttons 
                    that allow the user to show active participation by clicking them to move from one page to another. The third element is information planning which enables easy navigation on 
                    the structuring of the content including terminologies or search bars (Indeed Editorial Team, 2021). According to Papanek, users find symmetrical interfaces easier to understand than asymmetrical interfaces (1985: 4-5). 
                    This is because symmetry is simple and presents information legibly and spaciously. UI is the face of UX, but we need to look at UX before interfaces are designed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    User experience gives interfaces functionality and usability, it investigates the mood and experience of the user when they interact with a design determining whether they are having fun by accomplishing the goal or not and why that is so (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2006: 92-93). 
                    The most important part is knowing how the user feels, what they expect, why, and if they understand the system because not understanding causes confusion which can frustrate the user. UX is an important phenomenon and the foundation of the design process as it allows the planning 
                    and sharing of ideas through prototyping, wireframing, investigating, and so on. 
                </p>

                <h2 class="week">My suggested UI and UX</h2>
                <p>
                    I started the design process by designing the wireframes aiming to show my initial ideas, see illustrations and explanations below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <figure><img class="png" src="images/BlogPosts.png" alt="Blog pages wireframe">
                        <aside>
                            <h3 class="subt">Blogposts wireframe</h3>
                            <p>
                                I chose this layout because the information will be neatly presented and readable with a simple navigation.
                            </p>
                        </aside>
                    </figure>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <figure><img class="png" src="images/Homepage.png" alt="Homepage wireframe">
                        <aside>
                            <h4 class="subt">Homepage wireframe</h4>
                            <p>
                                The layout allows users to have options to navigate to other pages including links and sliders. 
                                The interface will include images to make it attractive. The left and right arrows will be buttons to allow the 
                                user to move the slider cards. I chose this layout because it will keep the content in order and the user will have 
                                a clear understanding when they navigate the page that they are on the homepage.
                            </p>
                        </aside>
                    </figure>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <figure><img class="png" src="images/DataArt.png" alt="Data-Art page wireframe">
                        <aside>
                            <h5 class="subt">Data-Art page wireframe</h5>
                            <p>
                                I have not thought about the layout of this page thoroughly. But surely the content will be spacious and well presented. 
                                There will be illustrations and more information about them.
                            </p>
                        </aside>
                    </figure>
                </p>

                            <p>
                                I chose the same layout as the blog posts’ page because the page will include a lot of information that I want to keep legible and spaciously presented. 
                                It will include critical writing of my style choices and reasons behind the choices as well as how these choices have or had impacts on the design.

                            <p>
                                More like the style guide page, it will include reflections on the design process and reasons behind my design choices.
                            </p>
                        </aside>

                            <p>
                                The layout will have illustrations with supporting captions, I chose it because it will present the 
                                content legibly, I might change it on the final design to a slider display to make it more appealing.
                            </p>
                        </aside>

                            <p>
                                I went for the slider layout to keep the content in one place and let the user have time to look at the 
                                wireframes slide-by-slide. I chose this type of layout because there will not be too much text on the page, and the wireframes have enough information on their own.
                            </p>
                        </aside>
                    </figure>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I wanted the user to have fun, feel keen to know what information other web pages hold, and express their emotions by giving feedback; then use their feedback and ideas to design a better website. 
                    Then for the presented user interface, I will briefly explain my design choices focusing on four aspects of the visual representation: typography, colour, graphics, and layout.
                </p>

                <p>
                    •	<span>Typography</span>: I used Times New Roman for the font because it is legible and spacious, it gives the reader a coherent text to engage with. Most people are familiar with it because it is an old font, it is neat and easy to read. 
                    I used different font sizes to suit the layout and to differentiate between texts like showing which one is the heading, this is because the reader will not be confused about where to start reading and what the content is about 
                    since headings can give the reader an insight of what they are going to read about. I also used different font weights to specify which text holds important information.
                </p>

                <p>
                    •	<span>Colour</span>: I wanted to keep the aesthetic appeal fresh and easy to look at, I used about six colours because I wanted to be exploratory and see if the colours will be complementary. I used a colour-blind-friendly palette which includes black, 
                    white/cream-white, light-pink, light blue/aqua, grey, and dark green. I used these colours because I wanted the website to look youthful and I feel like the colours worked well together to emphasize that. For all the paragraph texts on the pages 
                    I used white because it signifies simplicity and clarity also to avoid the text blending into the background images, I used black for some texts like on the home page to signify the power that the information holds and its elegance like the captions in the slider cards. 
                    Grey was used as the background colour in the footer to show the balance between the information in the body section and the footer section. Light pink and cream white were used for some subheadings and as the hovering colour on the socials because I wanted to give the text some 
                    youthfulness and bring a smooth flow of information, and I want the website to stay neutral between formality and informality, so a little pop of colour does the trick. I used aqua/light blue to make the links on all pages stand out and show some stability and balance in the text, 
                    also a dark green background shows when the user hovers in the links to the home, data visualization, and data-art pages to show the user that they can move to the pages without hesitations and see the importance of each link. All these colours were complementary, and I feel like so far, 
                    they work well together to achieve the youth idea of the website and its informality side.
                </p>
           
                <p>
                    •	<span>Graphics</span>: I used images from unsplash.com for the background images and images in the slider cards on the home page. I chose to use these images for aesthetic appeal and attraction. I still must resize and compress the images so that they do not take too much space, 
                    I used as dark images as possible on pages that have a lot of text so that the text does not blend in. Then I included graphics that I designed myself on the wireframes page.
                </p>

                <p>
                    •	<span>Layout</span>: I was working towards readability, coherence, and order, and I feel like I accomplished this with the graphics, font, and colour palette I used to design the website. The style guide, critical reflections, and blog posts almost have the same layout because 
                    they contain a lot of text without any illustrations, so I kept the layout simple. The home page and the wireframes page have slider displays to show the content, I chose these layouts because the content includes images and carried a lot of important information for the user to pay close attention to. 
                    Also, the layout enables effortless navigation through the page and makes it more attractive.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In conclusion, my UI and UX thus far are well done, and I am working to implement them more and bring better changes to the design using the feedback I received and are yet to receive. The user interface of the website should have an intellectual, spiritual, and emotional connection with the user; 
                    the functionality and usability of the website must be investigated more through prototypes and wireframes to end up with a design with good UI and UX.
