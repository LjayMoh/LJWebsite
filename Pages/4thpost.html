                <p>
                    Kirell Berin defines data art which is also known as data-driven art as an imaginative theory that uses 
                    data to convey feelings and information (2020). Data-driven artwork is an artwork that is created using data, 
                    it is the integration of data and art to transfer information through art to share emotions and give out information. 
                    Artists design artworks to communicate with their audiences through illustrations or materials as well as to express their emotions, 
                    thoughts, and share their life perceptions. Information and art can both shape societies because they both carry and convey messages 
                    that can impact how we see the world and how we think.  In simpler terms, the data driven artwork uses data to convey meaning in a computerized manner. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For my data-driven artwork, my goal was to make sure that I create something that will have aesthetic beauty and convey meaning, 
                    I wanted to create something that will make the viewer understand what I wanted to express and what emotions I wanted them to feel when 
                    interacting with the design. I wanted to express two emotions, these are, peace and harmony; I was working towards expressing these two emotions
                    because I wanted the information(data) to be easy to understand and to be kept simple as well as visually legible. I was not sure whether to use letters
                    and digits with different colours or to use several shapes with different colours to convey the meaning. I then decided that the shapes with different 
                    colours might be more aesthetically appealing and easy to understand as well as read. The goal here was to communicate a message through art or visuals 
                    in the simplest form, I am still in the process of achieving all the goals I set for this design, and I believe I will accomplish them. Below I have attached 
                    an example of how I wanted the design to look like when using the letters and digits to display the information. 
                    <figure><img src="images/Ukraine-Russian War Infographics & Data Visuals — Information is Beautiful.png" alt="" class="img-art4"></figure>
                    <figcaption class="text">Fig.1. Data Art by David McCandless, <em>Information is Beautiful</em>.</figcaption>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then below is an example of how I want the shapes to be with different colours, but I would like to use different shapes, I will think that through though.
                    <figure><img src="images/Top 500 Most Common Passwords Visualized — Information is Beautiful.png" alt="" class="img-art4"></figure>
                    <figcaption class="text">Fig.2. Data Art by David McCandless,<em>Information is Beautiful</em>, Ukraine Maps.</figcaption>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interaction plays an important role in connecting the user with the interfaces and the information they are interacting with (Thudt et al., 2018: 64-65), 
                    I want the interface to have useful interaction so that the user does not get bored with it and so that they can explore the data in every way they want to, 
                    this is through navigation, when the user hovers on a shape the shape changes colour which affects the shape of the object that will be next to it. 
                    I chose this interaction because I think it will bring a lot of fun and harmony to the interactions, and the player will feel at ease and feel a peace of mind 
                    as they navigate through the interface and interact with any shape they want. I will use as colour-blind friendly colours as possible so that accessibility is taken into consideration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do not want the design to have too many different colours so I will stick to most of the colours that the website already made use of, for instance, pink, blue, black, and white. 
                    I will use these colours because I want the data to enhance the meaning of the design of the website, the influence the shapes have on the colours and vice versa reveal new ways of 
                    interacting with data and thinking about it, as one will influence the change of the other. I am still not certain whether to include text to the design, I still want to keep in mind 
                    that I want the visuals to send a message without focusing too much on the text, maybe including a caption that describes the art a little will be fine. With my data art, 
                    I want to explore as much as I want the user to explore once they interact with the art, I want to have fun and put meaning in the artwork while expressing my feelings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, I have not started working on design of the data- art technically, this is so because I have no idea where to start, but I am going to work on it and see how far I will go. 
                    Data art is a very interesting theory which explores art done with data, it connects the viewer with the information, and it enables them to enter the artists world of imagination and feelings 
                    to understand the information better and from the artists perception. I am looking forward to seeing the final design of my data art, it is a fun process and a thoughtful one to make me think 
                    more about how I would express my artistic emotions through data.
