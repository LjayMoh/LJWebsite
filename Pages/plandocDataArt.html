                <p>
                    For my data-driven artwork, I aimed to design a data art that was interactive, legible, and aesthetically 
                    appealing. I wanted to ensure that I design something that will have meaning and express how I feel or what my 
                    ideas were to the users. The first step I took for designing this was to do research on how to go about with designing a data
                    art using D3.js, I watched YouTube channels to help me build my code and bring the idea to life. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to use  a minimum amount of four colors so that they would compliment the ones that the website already has, colors like
                    blue, pink, black, and white. I wanted to use these colors because they have some youthfulness, boldness, and life to them, and 
                    they will not be too much on the eyes. I was thinking of using different shapes or words and digits, to design the data but then I decided to use squares or
                    rectangles with different colors because I wanted the data to be easy to read as well as to show true and stable expressions/feelings that I wanted
                    the data art to give out. I wanted to keep the design as simple as possible as I was still learning how to go about designing a data-driven artwork.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of the interactivity, I wanted to design something that will be fun and aesthetically pleasing as well as easy to interact with, like when the user hovers on one shape I
                    wanted the action to affect the other object's color or shape. If I used words and digits, the user's interactivity with a certain word or digit would change them 
                    to another word or digits or change the color. So I thought about the idea carefully, then I decided to design somthing that will have two shapes, i.e., a circle and a square.
                    Whereby, the circle will be the foundation of the square and they will have different colors to them, when the user hovers on eithe on of the shapes the other object's color will change; 
                    I was also thinking of animating the square to keep rotating while the circle keeps changing color maybe from black to white as the square keeps rotating.
