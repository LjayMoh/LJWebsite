                <p>
                    The process of desiging the exam data art was more eye-opening and I put more effort to it. 
                    To start with the  design process I collected information and made research on how data-driven art os really designed,
                    I watched vidoes on Youtube and came across so any confusing code that almost amde me want to quit the process and focus on somthing else.
                    For the love  I have for movies, I came across a tutorial on YouTube by Ganesh H, who walks us throughthe process of designin different visualizations
                    from the beginning till the end. He designs diffrent interactive data visualization and art based on different data, for instance, 
                    design a scattertplot illustrating the USA gross domestic product, he uses the <a class="u-url" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/"> freecodecamp</a>
                    website to do the tutorials. The website is very useful to learn how to create different visualization, I decided to design the data-art using the collected data bout the top ranking of movies 
                    by the interest people show for them, I found the process really fun and education because my previous website did not have an interactive data art.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used differnt colours fo rthe layout of my data and to show the difference between the categories of the movies. To elaborate further, I used seven different colours to classify each 
                    movie category, these are khaki, tan, green, pink, lightblue, orange, and brown, I used these colors because they are colour-blind-friendly, easy on the eye, they are complementary, and youthful. 
                    The website in general used youthful colours as I did not want it to be too formal and lok dull, the main pursose was to use colours that bring light, decency, power, life, affection, and happinness
                    when the user interacts with the interfaces. The colours I used have aesthetical appeal and they are lively. Itried to wokr on making the art more interactive and show the tooltip which gives the viewer 
                    more information about the data they are interacting with, but I found that really difficult to tackle, I kept of working on the aspect of the data art but I did not have enough time to make sure it works.
                    Even hough that is the case, I still elieve I have improved in understanding how data-driven artworks are designed, and I am looking forward to designing more of them to strengthen my sills and knowledge.
                    I chose to design a treemap becasue I found it interesting even though it was a bit difficult, I always wanted to design a visualization that had squares or rectangles with different colours, showing different informations
                    and interactive. A lot of peole can relate to ranking movies depending on how they found them, this is a matter of whether they relate to the narrate or find it interesting or not, so I used this data because movies are something that a lot of people
                    engage with, and this might be an interesting way to give movie suggestions and educate people of the type of categories the movies they watch fall under.
