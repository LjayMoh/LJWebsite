                    <h1 class="subject"> Introduction</h1>
                    <p>
                        Erin McCoy stated that “visuals communicate information sixty thousand times faster than text” (2019), 
                        this proves that humans understand visually represented information faster and better than textualized information. 
                        Visuals often influence human insights because illustrations can catch the eye of the viewer to focus more on them than on the text, 
                        this can depend on how aesthetically appealing the visuals are and their legibility. Visualizations and art are used to express emotions and 
                        tell a narrative through readability, design, and connection, they are used to share the artist’s perspective and experiences in simple designs. 
                        Artists and designers use visuals to share societal, political, and environmental issues which are meant to make societies aware of their surroundings, 
                        they share visual information which they know will be easier understood and simply shape the world. For us to understand the complex technical innovations, 
                        we must investigate how data visualizations and data-driven artworks are represented and what message they are trying to convey. This essay will discuss and 
                        briefly explain what data visualization and data art are and the connection between them, this will focus on the representational methods of the two theories.

                    <h2 class="subject">What are Data Visualization and Data Art</h2>
                    <p>
                        Data visualization is the combination of two terms, these are ‘data’ which is collected information that is represented digitally and ‘visualization’ which means the process 
                        of creating graphics that convey a message. From these definitions the definition of what data visualization means is derived, it is a technique used to collect information and 
                        it using computer-generated graphics to convey meaning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Brush and Burns define data visualization as “…the practice of translating information into a visual context, such as a map or graph, to make data easier for the human brain to 
                        understand and pull insights from.” (2020), this means that data visualization is responsible for the examination of human perceptions (Li, 2020:17). The visualization acts as a signifier 
                        to convey meaning and make the reader understand what is being communicated faster, it emphasizes the holding of information through graphics. According to Viégas and Wattenberg (2007), 
                        visualization has two types, these are artistic visualization which is data visualization created by artists with the determination of creating art; and scientific visualization which 
                        means using computer-generated visuals to create graphics that carry meaning, it focuses on the examination of visual data, representing data pictorially to bring understanding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To design a good data visualization, human perception must be taken into consideration and the aspects of data visualization must be considered as well. The aspects are readability which 
                        focuses on carrying out the content as is, that has the quality and is clearly illustrated; recognizability which enables the reader to be aware of the information that is conveyed; 
                        and meaning which focuses on reinforcing the message the graphics give out (Li, 2020:41-42).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        New technologies and information that is shared technically shape society, and many people find it hard to adapt to the new technologies and they have controversies based on the new technologies (Roeser, n.d.). 
                        Some artists have been exploring and using new technologies to create new products, this is because the technologies make it easy for them to share and sell their artworks online such as NFTs, 
                        which enable artists to design data-driven artworks and share them all over the world for people to see and buy them if they connect with the artwork. Artists use their imaginations, skills, 
                        and knowledge to design these data artworks, they express their emotions and use the art to show people their life experiences. Roeser points out that “Techno-artists can create awareness of societal issues, 
                        and provide for critical reflection on technological and scientific developments.” (n.d.); this means that artists that have adapted to use new technologies to design their data artworks are making societies aware 
                        of the developments and innovations that are happening around them, and they use their artworks as an eye-opener to social challenges.  Data art which is also known as data-driven art is an imaginative theory that 
                        uses data to convey feelings and information (Berin, 2020), Roeser (n.d.), uses Piccinini’s artwork as an example of art that expresses feelings of mystery, embarrassment, as well as protection. Data-driven artwork is artwork created using data, 
                        it is the integration of data and art to transfer information that shares emotions and communicates perspectives. Artists that design data art use both exploration and explanation to create their artworks, they explore the data by providing the 
                        reader the opportunity to use their perspectives to understand the narrative behind the graphically represented data; then they explain the data by visually communicating to the readers (Thudt et al., 2018: 60).

                    <h3 class="subject">Data Visualization and Data Art Representation</h3>
                    <p>
                        The representation of data visualization and art uses semiotics such as code and texts to share and communicate information that shapes the world. We use a signifier and signified (Kidd, 2015: 21), to make sense of what we see and understand the meaning behind it. 
                        Data visualization and data art use graphics and code to represent information, and the two ideas use visual communication to communicate meaning, the codes that are used in this case are non-textual as they show illustrations. These graphics can mean different things 
                        depending on a person’s point of view and how they will interpret as well understand the historical context of the graphics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main objective of data-driven artworks and data visualizations is to visually communicate and present information and tell a narrative based on data. They all use interactive data interfaces (Thudt et al., 2018: 60), to present and convey meaning. 
                        Data visualizations are used in many research projects and studies to collect facts that will prove certain phenomena. Data art and visualization are used to share interactive information and make the data simpler to understand while being aesthetically pleasing. 
                        The theories have the advantage of visually representing huge amounts of data all at once, to make it easy for analysts and researchers to identify issues in terms of product quality control and make spectators understand small- and large-scale data (Li, 2020:18). 
                        The infographics are an easy way to make people have a long-lasting memory of the knowledge they gain from the information they interact with. Both data art and visualizations use graphical representation to communicate and present detailed data so that it can be easily digested.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Designers use different tools to design visualizations and artworks, they use, for instance, CSS used for the aesthetics of the graphics such as color, HTML used for the layout of the content, SVG used for the design of the graphs, diagrams, or maps, JavaScript used for the interface interaction, etc., 
                        (Bostock et al., 2011: 2301). They use D3 to design the graphics, which is an abbreviation for data-driven documents, an approach used to design visualization for the World Wide Web (www). The approach helps designers convert the textual data they collected to a visual component in the document object model (DOM) 
                        (Bostock et al., 2011: 2301), which displays the layout of the page, the content such as the structures of the paragraphs, and other aspects. The use of new technologies to design artworks and represent information has made the sharing of information to be much easier and better as many people are also adapting to the new technological innovations. 
                        Data visualization and data art help people understand the digital world better and faster as their representational mode (visual mode) takes complex data and simplifies it.

                    <h4 class="subject">Conclusion</h4>
                    <p>
                        We can conclude that data visualization which is an idea used to collect information and represent it using computer-generated graphics to convey meaning, and data art which is an imaginative theory that uses data to convey feelings and information; are both excellent ideas to use when artists want to visually present huge amounts of collected data all at once. 
                        The theories use graphical representations integrating code and graphics to communicate information. The artists integrate data and art which can be seen as visuals to express their emotions or feelings and to share their life experiences with other people. The graphical representations shape societies as the messages that are conveyed are mostly socially based 
                        because the artists share what is going on around the world and how they feel about it. They share their thoughts, feelings, experiences, situations, etc., all in one design and let the spectator understand as well as interpret the design from their perspectives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Human beings process visually represented information faster than text this is because visuals communicate and share information faster than text, and new technologies have made it easier for artists or designers to share large and small-scale data visually.  They use an approach known as data-driven documents (D3) to design and implement the data visualizations and art, 
                        with the help of different tools such as SVG, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and so on, to design the aesthetics, make sure there is the functionality of the interfaces, and ensure that the content of the page is well presented. Many artists have moved to design their artworks using new technologies and this is because it has become easier for people to access information faster using 
                        the internet and online platforms, artists use these technologies to make a profit by selling their data artworks online as they know that many people are adapting to the new technologies each day.
