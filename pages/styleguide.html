                    <h1 class="subject">Font</h1>
                    <p>
                    I decided to use Times New Roman from the font-family for the text in all the pages,this is because most people are familiar with it since it is an old font,
                    and it is used in many texts or word documents, also because it is neat and easy to read and has an economy of space for the reader to engage with a coherent text and understand it on first glance. I used different
                    font-sizes to best suit the layout and to show which text is the heading or the subtitle, then used different font-weights to specify which texts hold more important information to consider or pay attention to while reading.
                    Most importantly I used this font family so that the web pages would have space, legibility, and order so that the reader that does neither get confused on where to start reading nor find it hard to digest the information.

                </p>

                <p>
                    <h1 class="subject">Graphics</h1>
                    <p>
                        I used universe images from <a href="h-card">unsplash.com</a> for the background of the pages, I chose to use these images for the backgrounds to make
                        the pages attractive and appealing. This time I used dark images so that the text will not blend into the background and make it difficult for the user to read.
                        Other graphics I am yet to include are the drawings for the data visualizations and the data-art pages, I also designed illustrations of the wireframes to explore the user experience of the website in wireframes page. 
                    </p>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h1 class="subject">Color</h1>
                    <p>
                    I did not use too many colours to design this website because I wanted to keep everything simple and easy to look at. I used black, 
                    white/cream white, light-pink, light blue/ aqua blue, grey, and dark green. For all the paragraph texts in each page I used the color white or cream white,
                    this is because white signifies simplicity and clarity, I also did not want to use colors that would blend in to the background by any chance. 
                    For the information in the footer like the referencing and explanation of what Interactive Media is, as well as the contact icons and other small texts; I used black so that it can 
                    signify to the viewer the power and elegance the information holds; I used grey for the background color of the footer to show the user the balance between the information in the body section and the one
                    in the footer section and footer bottom. I used light pink/cream white for the sub-headings, because I wanted to give them some youthfulness, to make the reader flow into reading the texts.
                    Then for the links in every page and the text on the footer bottom I used aqua blue and light blue, because I wanted them to stand out and show some stability and balance to the text.
                    Then lastly, when the user hovers on the links I used the dark-green background color to show them that they can click the text and to give them a thought about the stability and importance of information each link has.

                    <h1 class="subject">Layout</h1>
                    <p>
                    For the layout of this website I decided to keep everything simple and make the visuals eye-catchy, hence I used images for the 
                    background on each page to complement the content that the page holds, I did my best to keep the text simple and use appropriate words and make the content easy to understand.
                    My aim  for this website was to ensure a smooth flow of the content on each page, form the homepage to the last one; I want readability, coherence, and order in the blog posts and making the viewer understand the information on each page without any confusion.
                    For the home page I decided to use the auto play slider to display the weekly blog post section and used a slider to display the web design section(wireframes, reflection, styleguide), which included, a complementary image with the information
                    in the blog, name of the author, and the date the post was posted. I went for this layout because I wanted to keep the page attractive and make it easy for
                    the user to navigate through the page and choose the post they would like to read effortlessly. I made sure that I include links to important content on each page,
                    so that the user does not have to navigate back back to the homepage to access the links to pages they want to engage with. I used the same layout for each blog post and made the wireframe page have a slideshow to make the viewer browse the page by pressing on the buttons to view the 
                    different wireframes that show the ideas I had fr the user experience and user interface.
