                    Every design goes through design questions before the final product can be decided, most designers
                    make prototypes to check the level of usability of their products. Papanek asks rhetorical questions in his reading, I quote “Should 
                    I design it to be functional or to be aesthetically pleasing?” and “Do you want it to look good or to work?” (1985:7), these questions
                    are the most complex questions that designers ask when making decisions about their designs. They help designers reach 
                    an understanding of how they will make the designs purposeful and legible.  So now, I am going to briefly explain the user interface and user experience
                    and discuss how integrating them can help design a better product and are helping me through this design process. Then I will thoroughly discuss how I 
                    used user interface and experience to reach my design choices.
                </p>

                    <h1 class="subject">What is the User Interface?</h1>
                    <p>
                        User interface allows the user to interact with the design, it shows the visual design of a product. Its purpose is to make the design look usable, meaningful,
                        and attractive. It gives the design an aesthetic look and brings a psychological and spiritual connection between the user and the design (Goldberg, 2022), for instance,
                        some users may experience nostalgia by just looking at the beauty of the design as well as the kind of layout that is used on it. It is more like the face of the design before the user can engage with the inner system and its function.
                        There are three important elements of user interface that designers should take into consideration when creating their products, these are, visual representation which focuses on the aspects 
                        that give the design an aesthetic sense, for instance, layout, colour, graphics, typography and so on. The second one is, interactive representation which focuses on the user input and gives the user the opportunity to navigate the design easily,
                        and examples can be buttons to enable the user to move from one place to another and show active participation or links that navigates the reader to other pages. 
                        The last element is information planning this is making sure that the structuring of the content enables an easy use for navigation by including search bars, buttons, terminologies and so on (Indeed Editorial Team, 2021). 
                        Users find symmetrical designs easier to understand than asymmetrical designs, this is because symmetry is full of simplicity (Papanek, 1985, 4-5), 
                        but it all depends on how the design is structured that will make it legible and spacious. Designing a good UI requires thinking about the feelings of the user when they will be interacting with the product and how to make the site accessible to them effortlessly.

                    <h1 class="subject">What is User Experience?</h1>
                    <p>
                        User experience is what makes the interfaces have a purpose and gives them functionality. It is what makes the users see if they are accomplishing their goals or not (Goldberg, 2022). 
                        It mostly focuses on the usability of the design, it gives ideas for the design of the product before its interface can be created, these ideas can be given using prototypes, research, wireframes, copywriting and so on.
                        UX involves specifying user expectations through thorough research, analysis, and examination then developing ideas from that investigated information, getting it to read for innovations, and then marketing (Indeed Editorial Team, 2021).  
                        The design of user experience figures out how the needs of users can be met by planning and testing different ideas and asking users to participate in giving useful feedback after engaging with the prototypes.

                    <h1 class="subject">How to see a good UI and UX.</h1>
                    <p>
                        A design starts with the foundation, which is the user experience. Every designer must do research before they get to the process of designing the interfaces, 
                        they should have a certain goal(s) they are willing to accomplish with their design and consider users' expectations ans feelings when designing the products. Strategizing, wireframing,
                        prototyping, testing, developing, and copywriting (Indeed Editorial Team, 2021) are what will make the design have a good user experience, because they open doors for the 
                        designer to get feedback and ideas they might have forgotten to add on the design from the targeted users and other designers. A good user interface is determined by good 
                        usability as it is the foundation of the design, the design must be readable with the information structured well, aesthetically pleasing, responsive, have good contrast, 
                        be functional, as well as be user friendly.    
                    </p>

                    <h1 class="subject">My UI and UX.</h1>
                    <p>
                        When I was designing my user interface, my focus was on making the design readable with good usability, a simple layout, with simple graphics. The first website I designed in first semester,
                        was not that appealing and its user interface design lacked a few things and was not too user friendly because there were times when the text blended in with the background image and this made it hard for the user to read the information.
                        I used the feedback I received as an advantage to help me design a better website this time, I will explain a few elements I used on my user interface below, just to note, I have explained the reasons behind the decisions I made on these elements 
                        in the <a class="u-url" href="pages/styleguide.html">Style guides</a> page.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        •	<span class="sp">Layout</span>: For the layout, I decided to use simple structures that would make it easier for the user to interact and digest the content. For instance,
                         I decided to use the same layout structure for the blog post webpages and I used slideshows on the home page and the wireframes page to make the navigation more engaging and fun.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        •	<span class="sp">Colour</span>: Same as the previous websites, I made use of the RGB colour palette, this includes colours that are colour-blind-friendly 
                         and not harsh to the eyes, e.g., black, blue, dusty pink, and cream-white. I made this decision because I wanted the user to navigate the website without having to dim their computer light 
                         to read through the information.    
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        •	<span class="sp">Graphics</span>: I used images for the background of each page, I used a similar image for the blog posts' backgrounds, 
                        then different images for the home, data visualizations, data-art, style guide, wireframes, and reflection pages. I used images that will show the content coherently and not 
                        blend with the text to make it easy for the user to read it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        •	<span class="sp">Typography</span>: The highest font size I used was 30pixels, mostly I used big font sizes for the headings, I used the same type of font I used on my previous websites 
                        which is Times New Roman, this is because it is common and easy to read as well as spacious.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For my user experience, I used the rubric, research, feedback from the previous websites, and wireframes to ensure that I meet the required expectations. 
                        My aim this time is to make sure that the information is readable and understandable, ensure that I work hard on the technical side of the website, and that the navigation is smooth throughout.
                        Even though this is just the prototype of the website I will be designing for the exam, I feel like I have put effort into designing it and I am willing to make it better form the feedback I will receive from my peers and the marker.
                    </p>

                    <p>   
                        In conclusion, both user interface and user experience are important, UI makes the design meet the expectations of users by ensuring that there is a vivid interaction 
                        between the user and the program of the site. It brings spiritual, emotional, and intellectual connections between the user and the design as well as the designer and the product. 
                        UX focuses on the functionality and importance of the design, it takes the target market(users) into consideration, meaning it is the foundation of the design process whereby ideas are shared 
                        and prototyped before the final product.
