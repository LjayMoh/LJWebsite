                    <h1 class="week">First chart: Instagram user in Africa by country and population (Dixon, 2022)</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The first thing I did to start the process of designing the charts was to do research on the topics I wanted the two static charts
                        to based on. For the first static chart, I chose the topic of Instagram users in Africa by the country and population in 2022, I chose this
                        topic because social media has taken over in our societies and it is shaping our lifestyles as well as influencing us to have social behavioural norms
                        like judging people from how they dress, what they do for a living, or who they are in relationships with. We live in a world now where information is no longer
                        spread or conveyed through word of mouth but we use social media to do that on a daily basis this is because it is easy to access and it is an easy way to pass 
                        information and communicate with people from all parts of the world.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Instagram is a social platform which enables people to share images and videos of their lifestyles with captions, with their friends and families known as 'followers',
                        I used Dixon's evaluations/investigations on Instagram users around the world by country and population (2022) to design my chart on Instagram users by eightt African countries and their populations. 
                        The counties are South Africa, Lesotho, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Central African Republic, Zambia, and Ghana (Dixon, 2022); from the investigations SA has the highest population of Instagram users 
                        compared to the other seven countries while Lesotho has the lowest population of Instagram users compared to the other seven countries. For the design of the chart I will put the names of the countries on the x axis
                        and make the population number measured in millions on the y axis, and display the results from highest to lowest because I want the data to be readable and have order.
                    </p>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h2 class="week">Second chart: Unemployment rate in SA by age in 2022 (Galal, 2022)</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The second chart will be based on the unemployment rate in South Africa by age in 2022 (Galal, 2022). I chose this topic because unemployment is a huge pandemic and a problem we are facing in South Africa.
                        A lot of people who are unemployed are aged between 15-24 years, this can be because some do not have education and they lack skills as well as experience, while some of the people in this group are graduates and 
                        it is said that the more educated a person is the more likely it is for them to be employed but the South African labour force is failing the graduates because a lot of them still remain unemployed even with those qualifications (Galal, 2022). The age groups 
                        will be 15-24 years, 25-34 years, 35-44 years, 45-54 years, 55-64 years (Galal, 2022). From these age groups people who are mostly employed are those between 55-64 years, I think this is because they have more work experience than the youth, which is understandable
                        but not fair at the same time because in order for the country to develop and for the unemployment rate to decrease, the youth must be given a chance and opportunities to have experience and enhace their skills in the work field, with or without experience; 
                        we can learn from working and skills can come in different ways like from communication, or art and design, so everyone who is capable of working must be given a chance to grow and develop their skills. 
                        I will use the age group as my x axis on the chart and the percentage of unemployment as my y axis, this will display the results accurately and orderly, starting from the age group of 15-24 years as having the 
                        highest percentage and the age group of 55-64 years with the lowest unemployment percentage.
                    </p>
                </p>
                        
                <p>
                    The charts will not be using many colors, I planning to use only two colors these are blue and pink. Blue will be used for all the bars in the first chart because I want to show stability and balance in the results then I will use pink for 
                    all the bars in the second chart to give it some youthfulness and signify that the youth should be taken into consideration when it comes to employment and they should be given opportunities in all fields of work. I am going to use only two colors because I want the charts to be simple to read and understand 
                    without the user having to find out which color present which information. The designs will the kept simple and static for the navigation to be smooth and for the interface to have an aesthetic appeal.
